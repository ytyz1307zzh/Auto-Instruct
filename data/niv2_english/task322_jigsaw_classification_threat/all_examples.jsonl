It is also worth noting that Le Pen has gained significant support amongst traditionally left-wing young voters who not only suffer massive unemployment, but who also see no hope of gainful employment in the future in spite of their academic qualifications.

If the result of the game decides who has home field advantage in the World Series, then two things need to happen:\n\n1 - Fans should have no say whatsoever in voting players onto the team.  It should be determined by statistics and only voted on by players/coaches.\n\n2 - The \"everyone gets to play\" mentality should end.  If a pitcher is shutting things down, let them pitch.  If an offensive player is raking, keep him in.  If some people on the roster don't get a chance to play, well too bad it's called a team and you're trying to win a game for your league.\n\nUntil that happens, the game should be just what it is - an exhibition game with no consequences or rewards for the outcome.

In October 2010, they merged with Continental which had always, in my experience, been a horrible airline. We were flying back from New England when Continental-uniformed staff stepped into United Airlines jobs and immediately the customer service took a nose-dive. I filed a complaint for the way they treated my mother-in-law for just being a little slow to respond to them. That was the same weekend the TSA started the nude photoscanning and pat down searches, so it was a miserable trip home and we're still waiting to hear back on that complaint.\n\nI wasn't surprised to see this in the news. Arrogance will always show in a company eventually. That their own crew had priority over a passenger makes me wonder if United's CEOs and middle managers need to take a course on capitalism.\n\nBack of this may be a government regulation about flight crew transport.

Where I worked the state employees were simply arrogant. But they could do no wrong as far as the company was concerned. It was under contract to them, so it was essentially employed to them. And as there are other companies the state could turn to the for the same service, the company would agree to anything the state workers wanted. That included getting rid of people the state workers didn't like for whatever reason. If you do move forward with this there is a very real possibility that you could lose your job.

Considering the amount of success he's had, it certainly wasn't a detriment.\n\nNow, however, having \"relocated\" to the Oval Office, he's been unmasked. For the first time in his life, Trump is in a situation where it's not all about what HE says or thinks and it's upsetting his applecart.

In the sample presented in\nthis paper, those who became HIV positive, engaged in higher\nrisk sexual behaviour and reported other poorer sexual health\noutcomes tended to have had their first anal intercourse at\na younger age than other men. With the median age of sexual\ndebut continuing to decline, clinicians and other health service\nproviders, as well as researchers, need to pay particular attention\nto gay men\u2019s earliest sexual experiences. In particular, men who\nreport having anal intercourse at a young age are likely to be at\nheightened HIV vulnerability and therefore require additional\neducation and support for ensuring a healthier sex life. Further\neducation around safer sex practices that specifically targets gay identified\nyouth may also be required to ensure their sexual\ndebut does not lead to poorer sexual health outcomes.", "target": "Non-threat"}

Obama did save the auto industry and went thru hell and high water trying to convince them that he cared about them. I know quite a few white men that would never accept a female leader, much less a strong assertive woman. They have been hating Hillary for 30 years. Their wives stood by their men. Like the mother of a cop that may think the Black Lives Matter movement is a threat to their child, those Rust Belt mothers feared many things that might endanger their families, like the opiate epidemic in Appalachia that is effecting mainly rural white folks.  They feared Hillary didn't care about them because she cared about minorities. In their mind, caring when it comes to minorities in general and black folks in particular, is a zero sum game.

The difference here is that Islam is an ideology, not a race or ethnicity.
