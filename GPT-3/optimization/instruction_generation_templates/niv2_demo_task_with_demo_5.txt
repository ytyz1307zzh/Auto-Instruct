Write an instruction on how to solve the following task.

Task: Creating complex reasoning questions based on a passage.

Examples:
Input: Passage: Poor special team mishaps and an attempted comeback that fell 6-yards short led the Eagles to win in a thriller of a game to drop the Giants to 2-12 despite the Giants going up 20-7 at one point and, tying their worst record since 1974. They also got swept by the Eagles which  allowed them to clinch a first round bye, and the loss dropped the Giants to 0-5 in the division. Despite their miscues, the Giants dominated on offense going for just under 500 yards and Eli Manning had his best performance this season. With a Redskins 20-15 win over the Cardinals, the Giants will finish in 4th place in the NFC East for the first time since 2003. The Giants are now 4-14 against the Eagles despite leading the series 84-82-2.
Output: How many points did the Redskins beat the Cardinals by?

Input: Passage: Kit sponsors BSR Housewares became the clubs first shirt English football sponsorship during the 1981-82 season. The clubs shirts have been sponsored for the majority of the time since then, although there was no shirt sponsor at the end of the 1993-94 season, after local solicitors Coucher & Shaw were closed down by the Law Society of England and Wales. Unusually for a Premier League club, Albion were again without a shirt sponsor for the start of the 2008-09 campaign, as negotiations with a new sponsor were still ongoing when the season began. The longest-running shirt sponsorship deal agreed by the club ran for seven seasons between 1997 and 2004 with the West Bromwich Building Society. Today the clubs principal sponsor is Ideal Boilers. Other sponsors have included T-Mobile (2004-08), Homeserve (2010-11), Bodog (2011-12), Zoopla (2012-14), QuickBooks (2014-15), Tlcbet (2015-16), K8 group (2016-2017), and Palm Eco-Town Development (2017-18).
Output: How many more years were West Bromwich Building Society the club sponsor than Quickbooks?

Instruction: This task involves creating questions from a given passage that involve some kind of complex reasoning (including numerical reasoning). 
The generated questions must require looking at more than one part of the passage to answer. Try to use a variety of reasoning types in your questions (some of the sample reasoning types are illustrated in the 'positive examples' field) and also have a variety of answer types (spans, numbers, dates). A span is a continuous phrase taken directly from the passage or question. In such questions, the answer spans are recommended to be five words. Questions with answer type "number", are expected to start with "How many". For instance, "How long did an event last?" can be phrased as "How many years did an event last?". To increase diversity, try to create more questions for which the answer will be multiple spans. Please create questions that require AT LEAST 2 arithmetic operations as illustrated in the 'positive examples' field. You are encouraged to try DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS of operations and not just limit to the combinations shown in those examples. The more challenging questions you create, the better it is.



Write an instruction on how to solve the following task.

Task: Writing incorrect answers to a given question based on a given sentence.

Examples:
Input: Fact: DNA contains genetic instructions for proteins where polymerase joins the nucleotides together. 
Question: DNA contains what for proteins where polymerase joins the nucleotides together.? 
Correct Answer: genetic instructions.
Output: acids.

Input: Fact: ferns release oxygen during the day but not during the night. 
Question: What releases oxygen during the day but not during the night? 
Correct Answer: ferns.
Output: cats.

Input: Fact: a planet accelerates because of gravity. 
Question: What causes a planet to accelerate? 
Correct Answer: gravitational pull.
Output: magnets.

Instruction: Write an incorrect answer to the given question based on the associated fact. You are also provided with the correct answer to the given question. Make sure that your incorrect answer is relevant and similar to the associated fact. Also, try to make the incorrect answer similar to the correct answer so that distinguishing the correct answer from the incorrect answer is not very easy. Make sure you don't accidentally provide another correct answer! Also, make sure they sound reasonable (e.g., might be on a school pop quiz). A good incorrect answer can be constructed using words associated with the question, but not the correct answer. For example, for the question "What helps plants survive?", using words like "weeds", "vase", "bee" (associated with "plant"), or "first aid", "parachute", "accident" (associated with "survive") etc. Your incorrect answers make the question hard, so these results in good incorrect answers.

Write an instruction on how to solve the following task.

Task: Verifying the temporal reasoning category of a given question.

Examples:
Input: Sentence: After several years of private practice from 1982-90, he became the judge of Decatur County Court for a year. 
Question: How often are judges elected? 
Category: Frequency.
Output: Yes.

Input: Sentence: The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 U.S. silver dollar, which sold for $4.14 million in 1999. 
Question: Is the silver dollar still available for public viewing? 
Category: Transient v. Stationary.
Output: Yes.

Input: Sentence: Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. 
Question: Has there been a break in the war since it began? 
Category: Transient v. Stationary.
Output: No.

Instruction: Indicate with `Yes` if the given question involves the provided reasoning `Category`. Indicate with `No`, otherwise. We define five categories of temporal reasoning. First: "event duration" which is defined as the understanding of how long events last. For example, "brushing teeth", usually takes few minutes. Second: "transient v. stationary" events. This category is based on the understanding of whether an event will change over time or not. For example, the sentence "he was born in the U.S." contains a stationary event since it will last forever; however, "he is hungry" contains a transient event since it will remain true for a short period of time. Third: "event ordering" which is the understanding of how events are usually ordered in nature. For example, "earning money" usually comes before "spending money". The fourth one is "absolute timepoint". This category deals with the understanding of when events usually happen. For example, "going to school" usually happens during the day (not at 2 A.M). The last category is "frequency" which refers to how often an event is likely to be repeated. For example, "taking showers" typically occurs ~5 times a week, "going to Saturday market" usually happens every few weeks/months, etc.

Task: Given a list concatenate and then mirror/reverse all the elements starting from ith element and ending at jth element

Examples:
Input: 3, 5, ['9323', '8215', '2303', 'l', 'C', 'F']
Output: Cl3032

Input: 3, 5, ['a', 'b', '5435', '9981', '3279', '4437', 'z', 'S', '8257', '355', '1753', '3085', 'C', 'j', '1425', '2839', '4951', 's', 'P']
Output: 972318995345

Input: 3, 20, ['W', 'E', '2135', '153', '3581', '3611', 'D', 'Y', '3363', '463', '6885', '3475', 'j', 'B', 'O', '3795', '5145', 'o', '5809', '5883']
Output: 38859085o54155973OBj574358863643633YD116318533515312

Instruction: In this task, you are given inputs 'i', 'j', and A, where 'i' and 'j' are integers and A is a list. A list is shown by two brackets and comma-separated numbers and characters inside, like ['1', '12', 'l']. You need to concatenate all elements of A from the ith element to the jth element, and then reverse the resulting string. 'i' and 'j' will be non-negative, and will always have a value less than the length of A. 'i' will always be less than 'j'. Perform the operations in order, i.e., do not reverse first and then concatenate.



Write an instruction on how to solve the following task.

Task: Given a debate topic and a sentence from the debate, classify the type of the sentence.

Examples:
Input: topic: There is a smallest distance
sentence: 
  
You are correct and indeed I intended to make that in the comment section but was half asleep at the time.
Output: Testimony

Input: topic: Should abortion be made illegal?
sentence: You can argue a right to life, and sure, give it that.
Output: Policy

Input: topic: iPods are taking the magic out of music.
sentence: I think easy listening it great.
Output: Value

Instruction: In this task, you will be given a debate topic, along with a sentence from the debate. You should classify the given sentence and choose the type of that sentence. Possible types are explained below.
Policy: This refers to a sentence proposing a specific course of action to be taken. It typically contains modal verbs like "should" and "ought to". It cannot be directly proved with objective evidence, and a proper type of support is a logical reason from which the proposition can be inferred.
Value: This refers to a sentence containing value judgments without making specific claims about what should be done (If so, then it is a Policy sentence.). Because of the subjectivity of value judgments, it cannot be proved directly with objective evidence.
Fact: This refers to an objective proposition expressing or dealing with facts or conditions as perceived without distortion by personal feelings, prejudices, or interpretations. A Fact sentence has a truth value that can be verified with objective evidence that may be available at the time the claim is made; predictions about future are considered unverifiable.
Testimony: This refers to an objective sentence about the author's personal state or experience. Evidence for Testimony is not publicly available in most cases.
